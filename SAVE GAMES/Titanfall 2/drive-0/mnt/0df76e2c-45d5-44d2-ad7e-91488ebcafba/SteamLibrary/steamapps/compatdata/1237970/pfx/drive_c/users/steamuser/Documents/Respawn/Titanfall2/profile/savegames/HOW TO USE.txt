These saves are meant to be practice saves additional to the already available NCS saves, I highly recommend getting those aswell if you don't have them already!

WHAT YOU NEED BEFOREHAND:
- a custom .cfg file in your game folder (Titanfall2/r2/cfg)
- a working version of Icepick (titanfallmods.com)

HOW TO INSTALL & USE:
1. Drop all the .sav files into C:\Users\[USER]\Documents\Respawn\Titanfall2\profile\savegames

2. Set up a bind to open up the console in your custom config file via: bind "KEY" "toggleconsole"

3. Launch the game through Icepick (NOT SPEEDRUN LEGAL! ONLY FOR PRACTICE)

4. Open up the console using your bind and enter: load [SAVENAME]
